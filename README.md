# Customer Segmentation and Recommendation

## About
**Customer Segmentation Recommendation** is a machine learning-based project that analyzes user data and preferences to provide **product recommendations** at a micro-segment level. It also helps marketing teams make better marketing strategies by analyzing customers based on their **buying behavior**.  

**Micro-segmentation** is the process of dividing a market of potential customers into groups (segments) based on different characteristics.

## Types of Market Segmentation
- **Demographic segmentation**: age, gender, income, etc.  
- **Psychographic segmentation**: interests, lifestyle, etc.  
- **Behavioral segmentation**: purchase & spend habits, brand interactions, etc.  
- **Geographic segmentation**: city, country, etc.  

Based on the analysis, users were divided into various categories such as:  

- **Tech**: Tech Savvy, Luxurious, Flagship Killers, Others  
- **Brand Lovers**: Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Others  
- **Camera Lovers**: Sensible, PhotoPhile, Selfie Lover

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Machine Learning:** Classification & Regression Algorithms, Neural Networks  
- **Data Collection:** Models trained using data scraped from the Internet

## Project Setup

### 1. Install Python
- Python version: 3.5.9  
- Download link: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Run the following command for each library:

```bash
pip install <library-name>
Package  	Version
matplotlib 	3.1.2
missingno 	0.4.2
numpy	      1.18.1
pandas    	1.0.0
sklearn	    0.0
tensorflow	2.0
keras     	2.3.0
seaborn	    0.10.0
flask     	1.1.1
flask-Cors	3.0.8
```


### 3. Run the Project

```bash
Start the backend server:

python server.py
```


After successfully running "server.py" file, go to "frontend folder ->html folder ->dbshome.html",run "dbshome.html" file,thus the project will be setup successfully

Inorder to have better understanding of code,install Anaconda-Navigator after that open jupyter-notebooks and open this folder "python-notebooks" on jupyter notebook and run files accordingly in that folder
